**Open the current repository in the Tower Git client via a button in the VS Code status bar.**

<!-- /short-description -->

## Getting started

_Let's assume you have [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Tower](https://www.git-tower.com/) installed._

Install the extension from the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kitschpatrol.open-in-git-tower-button), or run the following in VS Code's command palette:

```sh
ext install kitschpatrol.open-in-git-tower-button
```

After which you should see a new icon in your status bar:

![open-in-git-tower-button banner](assets/screenshot.webp)

Due to a lack of an ideal [codicon](https://microsoft.github.io/vscode-codicons/dist/codicon.html), the solid "filter" icon will have to suffice with its tower-approximating silhouette.

## Acknowledgments

This trivial extension layers over [Fabio Spampinato's](https://fabiospampinato.com/) [Open in GitTower](https://github.com/fabiospampinato/vscode-open-in-gittower), which does the heavy lifting of actually opening things in Tower.

[Anthony Fu's](https://antfu.me/) [VS Code Open in GitHub Button](https://github.com/antfu/vscode-open-in-github-button) extension provided a basic template for the approach.
